Release Notes
=============

**Version 0.55**

Instead of returning only the solver log and the solution as strings, a job now additionally returns statistics like objective value, runtime, bound, etc.

**Version 0.54**

The QUBOSpecBuilder() now enables a scoring for the branching decisions by default.

**Version 0.53**

- Coefficient tightening as part of QUBO presolving is no longer supported and removed from the QUBOSpecBuilder(). 
- It is now possible to enable quantum heuristics (e.g., via a D-Wave Simulator) for solving QUBOs. This is done by an add_quantum_heuristic()-method of the QUBOSpecBuilder().
