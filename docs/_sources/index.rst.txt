The `Quantagonia <https://www.quantagonia.com/>`_ HybridSolver is a cloud-based hybrid classic-quantum solver for mathematical optimization problems. The HybridSolver solves mixed-integer linear optimization problems (MILPs) and quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBOs) to global optimality. The solver runs hardware-agnostic on CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs. For more information on the solver, see `this page <https://www.quantagonia.com/hybridsolver>`_. To use the solver, please sign up at `platform.quantagonia.com <https://platform.quantagonia.com>`_. For further questions, please contact support@quantagonia.com.

    .. grid-item-card:: Versatile

        The HybridSolver solves mixed-integer linear optimization problems (MILPs) and quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBOs) to global optimality.

    .. grid-item-card:: Hardware-agnostic

        The HybridSolver is cloud-based and runs hardware-agnostic on CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs. Thus, you need never worry about what hardware is best for your decision problem.

    .. grid-item-card:: Easy to integrate

        The HybridSolver comes with a command-line interface (CLI) to solve optimization problems without setup and an API to integrate the solver into your projects.
