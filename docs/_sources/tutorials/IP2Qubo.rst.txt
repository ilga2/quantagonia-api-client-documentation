Creating a MIP
================

For modeling (MIP/LP ?) problems `PulP <https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/>`_ is supported and instances can be modeled and solved.
It is possible to convert (MIP/LP ?) problems to QUBO, even though modeling and solving a problem as QUBO directly is more efficient.

Note that the usage of (MIP/LP ?) problems is limited to integer and binary variables.

This is an example of creating a knapsack MIP problem instance with PulP. It is converted to QUBO and submitted for solving:

    - lambda or auto scaler things
