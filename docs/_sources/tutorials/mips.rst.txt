Modeling and Solving MIPs
=============================

Create a MIP
================

For modeling MIP problems `PulP <https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/>`_ is supported and instances can be modeled and solved.
It is possible to convert problems to QUBO, even though modeling and solving a problem as QUBO directly is more efficient.

The Quantagonia Cloud also allows to model and solve MIPs.
Our API natively supports to model MIPs via `PulP <https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/>`_ as demonstrated in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/ip2qubo_knapsack.py
    :lines: 1-6, 9-25

Solve a MIP
============

The :class:`QPuLPAdapter` offers a function to submit MIP problems to the cloud and solve as such:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/ip2qubo_knapsack.py
    :lines: 7-8, 32-41

Alternatively, MIP problems can be submitted as .lp or .mps files (or sets of files) as described in :ref:`submit_files_label`.
