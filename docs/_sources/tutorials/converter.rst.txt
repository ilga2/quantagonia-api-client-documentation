It is possible to import problem instances from Qiskit or Ocean into a :class:`QuboModel` via the classes :class:`QiskitQPAdapter` and :class:`DWaveCQMAdapter`.
However, the conversion is limited to:

 - binary variables
 - quadratic or linear objective functions
 - linear constraints


Converting from Ocean
""""""""""""""""""""""
This is an example that creates a problem instance for the `binary packing example of D-Wave <https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/examples/hybrid_cqm_binpacking.html>`_ and converts it into a :class:`QuboModel`:

Converting from Qiskit
"""""""""""""""""""""""

This Qiskit example implements an instance of the bin packing problem and converts it into a :class:`QuboModel`.
In the bin packing problem, the objective is to pack a set of weighted items into a number of bins with limited capacity while minimizing the number of bins used.
